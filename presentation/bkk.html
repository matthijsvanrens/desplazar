						<p class="text text-01">Welcome to the Bread-baking and Confectionery Plant, OJSC, founded in 1986 in Kazan. For 25 years it has been an <br /> industry leader in the Republic of  Tatarstan, Russia.</p>
						<p class="text text-02">The plant is equipped with modern automated production lines from leading European vendors. A highly efficient climate <br /> control system is employed to ensure superior quality of our bread 365 days a year.</p>
						<p class="text text-03">Our company participates in all major industrial contests and food shows of regional and federal status. In late 2011, we <br /> were proud to be awarded the “Taste of Quality” and “Top 100 Russian products” prizes that attest to our nationwide <br /> recognition.</p>
						<p class="text text-04">Since 2004, the Bread-baking and Confectionery Plant of Kazan has been annually certified for compliance with the <br /> requirements of the international standards in management and quality, ISO 9001 and ISO 22000.</p>
                        <p class="text text-05">Another standard that is strategically important for us to meet is the Halal Production requirements. Since 2005, <br /> when we started certifying our products for the Muslim market, the number of Halal items we produce has reached <br /> 70 and counting. The compliance with Halal requirements is guaranteed by the Committee on the standard “Halal” in <br /> the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Tatarstan. We are convinced that Halal is a very significant quality mark for <br /> millions of our customers, and we proudly introduce several new Halal-certified items every year.</p>
