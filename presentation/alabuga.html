												<strong>Ideal site to place the plastic processing plant</strong> <br />
												The SEZ “Alabuga” has several competitive advantages. First of all, Tatarstan produces 220 mln. barrels of crude oil per year, which is then refined at two large petrochemical plants. Almost all of the existing plastic resins and synthetic rubbers needed for plastic processing, namely LDPE/HDPE/LLDPE (over 500,000 MT), PP (180,000 MT), GPPS/HIPS (100,000 MT), PC (65,000 MT), ABS (65,000 MT from 2009), EPS (80,000 MT from 2010), synthetic rubbers (over 500,000 MT), are produced locally. <br />
												The Russian market of plastic goods is growing at a steady pace and there is still substantial import of plastics. It is considered that up to the half of the residents will handle polymer processing.
											</p>

											<p>
												<strong>In the center of automobile industry </strong> <br />
												Tatarstan is located in the industrial heartland of Russia. Most major Russian carmakers, namely AVTOVAZ, GAZ, UAZ, KAMAZ, IZHavto and many others are located within 500 km from the SEZ “Alabuga”. The Russian market for automobiles is growing rapidly, which is encouraging the world’s largest automotive companies to locate production facilities in Russia. Consequently, it makes logistical sense to locate automotive components production facilities in the SEZ “Alabuga”.
