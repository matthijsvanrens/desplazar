								<p class="text text-01">The territory of the SEZ “Alabuga” is 20 km². The master plan is based on the best examples of the international <br /> experience. Each plot has access to all necessary utilities — gas, electricity, water, heat, sewerage, telecommunication <br /> lines. There is no connection fee for SEZ “Alabuga” utilities. The Government has already invested up to USD 800 mln.</p>
								<p class="m-header m-header-01">The Free Customs Zone</p>
								<p class="text text-02">It is advantageous to place modern, hi-tech production that requires importation of equipment and components in the <br /> SEZ “Alabuga”. Equipment and goods are exempt from import duties and VAT for the duration of their presence on the <br /> territory of the zone. In addition, there is no export duty when the equipment leaves the zone. There is a state-of-the-art <br /> sixty hectare customs terminal specifically for the use of zone residents. Cargo can be transferred to the customs <br /> terminal via main roads and the railway system. The railway network of the zone is connected to the Russian Federal <br /> Railway system, giving investors the opportunity to ship cargo to the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea or the Pacific Ocean. <br /> There is a special container site for keeping up to 1,500 pieces of railroad cargoes and processing 100 pieces of cargo <br /> per day. The network of modern roads within the zone provides the opportunity to transfer cargo directly from the <br /> entrance to the residents’ area.</p>
